# Metadata Injector for PDS Labels (MILabel)

This is a software tool, formerly known as "Generate Tool", that provides a command-line interface for generating PDS4 Labels using a user-provided PDS4 XML template and input (source) data products to parse the metadata from the source and inject into the output PDS4 labels. The XML-like Templates use Apache Velocity variables and logic to enable the programmatic generation of the labels.


## Documentation

The documentation for the latest release of MILabel, including release notes, installation and operation of the software are online at https://nasa-pds.github.io/mi-label/.

If you would like to get the latest documentation, including any updates since the last release, you can execute the `mvn site:run` command and view the documentation locally at http://localhost:8080.


## ðŸ‘¥ Contributing

Within the NASA Planetary Data System, we value the health of our community as much as the code. Towards that end, we ask that you read and practice what's described in these documents:

-   Our [contributor's guide](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) delineates the kinds of contributions we accept.
-   Our [code of conduct](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) outlines the standards of behavior we practice and expect by everyone who participates with our software.


##  Build

The software can be compiled and built with the `mvn compile` command but in order to create the JAR file, you must execute the `mvn compile jar:jar` command.

In order to create a complete distribution package, execute the following commands: 
```console
$ mvn site
$ mvn package
```

## Operational Release

A release candidate should be created after the community has determined that a release should occur. Thanks to [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and the [Roundup Action](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/roundup-action), this can happen automatically. However, manual steps are given below should the need for a hand-made release arise.


### Clone a Fresh Repository

Run:

    git clone git@github.com:NASA-PDS/mi-label.git


### Release with ConMan

For internal JPL use, the ConMan software package can be used for releasing software, otherwise the following sections outline how to complete these steps manually.


### Manual Release

Manual release steps are detailed in this subsection.


#### Update Version Numbers

Update pom.xml for the release version or use the Maven Versions Plugin, e.g.:
```console
$ # Skip this step if this is a RELEASE CANDIDATE, we will deploy as SNAPSHOT version for testing
$ VERSION=1.15.0
$ mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$VERSION
$ git add pom.xml
```

#### Update Changelog

Update Changelog using [Github Changelog Generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator). Note: Make sure you set `$CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN` in your `.bash_profile` or use the `--token` flag.
```console
$ # For RELEASE CANDIDATE, set VERSION to future release version.
$ github_changelog_generator --future-release v$VERSION
$ git add CHANGELOG.md
```

#### Commit Changes

Commit changes using following template commit message:
```console
$ # For operational release
$ git commit -m "[RELEASE] mi-label v$VERSION"
$
$ # For release candidate
$ CANDIDATE_NUM=1
$ git commit -m "[RELEASE] mi-label v${VERSION}-rc${CANDIDATE_NUM}"
$
$ # Push changes to main
$ git push -u origin main
```

#### Build and Deploy Software to [Sonatype Maven Repo](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/gov/nasa/pds/).
```console
$ # For operational release
$ mvn clean site deploy -P release
$
$ # For release candidate
$ mvn clean site deploy
```

Note: If you have issues with GPG, be sure to make sure you've created your GPG key, sent to server, and have the following in your `~/.m2/settings.xml`:
```xml
<profiles>
  <profile>
    <activation>
      <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <properties>
      <gpg.executable>gpg</gpg.executable>
      <gpg.keyname>KEY_NAME</gpg.keyname>
      <gpg.passphrase>KEY_PASSPHRASE</gpg.passphrase>
    </properties>
  </profile>
</profiles>
```

#### Push Tagged Release
```console
$ # For Release Candidate, you may need to delete old SNAPSHOT tag
$ git push origin :v$VERSION
$ 
$ # Now tag and push
$ git tag v${VERSION}
$ git push --tags
```

#### Deploy Site to Github Pages

From cloned repo:
```console
$ git checkout gh-pages
$ 
$ # Create specific version site
$ mkdir -p $VERSION
$ 
$ # Copy the over to version-specific and default sites
$ rsync -av target/site/ $VERSION
$ rsync -av $VERSION/* .
$ 
$ git add .
$ 
$ # For operational release
$ git commit -m "Deploy v$VERSION docs"
$ 
$ # For release candidate
$ git commit -m "Deploy ${VERSION}-rc${CANDIDATE_NUM} docs"
$ 
$ git push origin gh-pages
```

#### Update Versions For Development

Update `pom.xml` with the next SNAPSHOT version either manually or using Github Versions Plugin.

For RELEASE CANDIDATE, ignore this step.
```console
$ git checkout main
$ 
$ # For release candidates, skip to push changes to main
$ VERSION=1.16.0-SNAPSHOT
$ mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$VERSION
$ git add pom.xml
$ git commit -m "Update version for $VERSION development"
$ 
$ # Push changes to main
$ git push -u origin main
```

#### Complete Release in Github

Currently the process to create more formal release notes and attach Assets is done manually through the [Github UI](https://github.com/NASA-PDS-Incubator/mi-label/releases/new) but should eventually be automated via script.

*NOTE: Be sure to add the `tar.gz` and `zip` from the `target/` directory to the release assets, and use the CHANGELOG generated above to create the RELEASE NOTES.*

### Snapshot Release

Deploy software to Sonatype SNAPSHOTS Maven repo:
```console
$ # Operational release
$ mvn clean site deploy
```

## Maven JAR Dependency Reference

This subsection lists reference URLs for the various releases.
