      <p>Note: The command-line examples in this section have been broken into multiple lines for readability. The commands should be reassembled into a single line prior to execution.

    <section name="Tool Execution">
      <p>MILabel can be executed in various ways. This section describes how to run the tool, as well as its behaviors and caveats.

      <subsection name="Command-Line Options">
        <p>The following table describes the command-line options available:
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr><th>Command-Line Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
          <tr><td>-b,--base-path &lt;base path mask&gt;</td><td>Specify the base file path mask to be stripped from the input file path to allow output in a relative directory structure. Requires -o flag to also be specified.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-d,--debug</td><td>Verbose debugging output. Shows each step of parsing and label generation.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-h,--help</td><td>Display usage.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-o,--output-path &lt;output path&gt;</td><td>Specify an output path to output the new PDS4 labels. By default, the file will output in same location as the input file.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-p,--pds3-label &lt;pds3 label&gt;</td><td>Parse the file or list of files as PDS3 Standard labels (also applicable for VICAR labels).</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-t,--template &lt;velocity template&gt;</td><td>Specify the file path for the Velocity template used to convert the input label(s).</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-I, --include &lt;paths&gt;</td><td>Specify paths to search for files referenced by pointers in a label. This flag is valid only when using the product-tools library as the underlying parser. Separate each path with a comma. Default is to always look in the directory of the label, then search the specified directories.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-V,--version</td><td>Display application version.</td></tr>
        </table>

      <subsection name="Execute MILabel">
        <p>This section demonstrates execution of the tool using the command-line options. The examples below execute the tool via the batch/shell script.
        </p>

        <p>The following command demonstrates how to run the MILabel to convert from a PDS3 Label to a PDS4 Label using a Velocity template file and output to a file:
        </p>

        <source>
% pds-generate -p &lt;pds3-label-path&gt; -t &lt;velocity-template-path&gt;
        </source>

        <p>The output would go into a file &lt;pds3-label-path&gt;.xml (i.e. $HOME/mpf123.img -&gt; $HOME/mpf123.xml
        </p>

        <p>The following command demonstrates how to run the MILabel to convert from a PDS3 Label to a PDS4 Label using a Velocity template file and output all debug information to standard out:
        </p>

        <source>
% pds-generate -d -p &lt;pds3-label-path&gt; -t &lt;velocity-template-path&gt;
        </source>

      </subsection>
    </section>
    
    <section name="Advanced Usage">
      <p>This section describes more advanced ways to run the tool, as well as its behaviors and caveats.
      </p>
      
      <subsection name="Changing the Underlying Parser">
        <p>The MILabel defaults to using the VicarIO library as the underlying parser when parsing input labels. The tool provides a capability to change the underlying parser to use the Product-Tools library instead. A common use case of changing the underlying parser is when an input label contains a ^STRUCTURE pointer. This section details how to set the underlying parser to the product-tools library.
        </p>
        
        <p><b><i>UNIX-Based Environment</i></b></p>
        
        <p>To change the underlying parser, set the <i>pds.generate.parser.type</i> Java system property to <i>product-tools</i> in the <i>pds-generate</i> shell script as follows:
        </p>
        
        <source>
Change the following line 
        
${JAVA_CMD} -jar ${GENERATE_JAR} "$@"

to
        
${JAVA_CMD} -Dpds.generate.parser.type=product-tools -jar ${GENERATE_JAR} "$@"                
        </source>
        
        <p><b><i>Windows Environmnet</i></b></p>
        
        <p>To change the underlying parser, set the <i>pds.generate.parser.type</i> Java system property to <i>product-tools</i> in the <i>pds-generate.bat</i> batch file as follows:
        </p>
        
        <source>
Change the following line 
        
"%JAVA_HOME%"\bin\java -jar "%MILABEL_JAR%" %*

to

"%JAVA_HOME%"\bin\java -Dpds.generate.parser.type=product-tools -jar "%MILABEL_JAR%" %*               
        </source>
        
        <p><b><i>API Method</i></b></p>
        
        <p>When calling the MILabel Generator Tool through the API, add the following line of code to change the underlying parser to use the PDS3 Product Tools library:
        </p>
        
        <source>
System.setProperty("pds.generate.parser.type", "product-tools");
        </source>
