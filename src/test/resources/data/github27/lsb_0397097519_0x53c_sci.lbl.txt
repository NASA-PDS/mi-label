By mutual agreement with PDS-SBN, FITS headers are the domain of the NH       
Project and were not part of the peer review beyond adherence to the          
FITS standard.  FITS header values, especially geometric conventions          
regarding phase angle, direction of supplied vectors and sense of light       
time and stellar aberration corrections, were chosen to serve                 
operational purposes and should be used with care.

By mutual agreement with PDS-SBN, FITS headers are the domain of the NH       
Project and were not part of the peer review beyond adherence to the          
FITS standard.  FITS header values, especially geometric conventions          
regarding phase angle, direction of supplied vectors and sense of light       
time and stellar aberration corrections, were chosen to serve                 
operational purposes and should be used with care.
